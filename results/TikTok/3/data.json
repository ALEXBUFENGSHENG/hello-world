    "Thought": "Since the instruction is to \"Swipe videos in TikTok. Click 'like' for 3 pet video cat,\" the next step is to look for a video featuring a cat.

    "Thought": "Based on the initial instruction, the task was to \"Swipe videos in TikTok. Click 'like' for 3 pet video cat.\" Given that two cat videos have been successfully liked (indicated by the change in the heart icon's color), the next step is to find a third cat video and click \"like\" on it.",
