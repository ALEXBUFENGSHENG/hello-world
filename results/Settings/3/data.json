    "Observation": "The screenshot shows the home screen of a smartphone. The screen displays various apps such as Settings, Contacts, My Files, Calendar, Weather, Clock, Calculator, Recorder, Wallet, Phone Manager, Compass, Notes, Maps, Chrome, Gmail, Play Store, TikTok, Alibaba.com, Amazon Music, YouTube, along with Phone, Messaging, Camera, and Gallery icons at the bottom. The status bar at the top shows that it's 13:40, with battery and signal indicators. There are no indications of previous operations, and the screenshot does not display the real-time internet speed.",
    "Thought": "To display real-time internet speed at the battery level, usually a specific app or a system setting is required. Most native system UIs do not display this information by default, so an app might be needed for this functionality. However, since I am only able to perform actions on what is present on the screen, I'll first check the Settings to see if there is a built-in option to show internet speed in the status bar, as some custom Android skins might have this feature built-in.",
    "Action": "open App (Settings)"

  "2": {
    "Observation": "The current screenshot shows the main page of the settings app, with various options including 'Flexible windows,' 'Quick launch,' a user account information section, 'Wi-Fi,' 'Mobile network,' 'Bluetooth,' and 'Connection & sharing.' No previous operations are indicated here other than the initial opening of the settings app.",
    "Thought": "To display real-time internet speed at the battery level, the settings related to the display or status bar (where such information is typically shown) need to be accessed. However, such a setting may not be natively available on all devices and might require a third-party app or developer options to be enabled. The 'Battery' or 'Display' settings should be looked for in the settings menu.",
    "Action": "page down."
  },
  "3": {
    "Observation": "The current screenshot shows the Settings menu scrolled down from the previous view. Newly visible options include \"Personalizations,\" \"Home screen & Lock screen,\" \"Display & brightness,\" \"Sound & vibration,\" and \"Notifications & status bar.\" There are no visible options directly related to real-time internet speed display at the battery level.",
    "Thought": "To attempt to display real-time internet speed at the battery level, it is often related to the status bar or notification panel where battery information is usually displayed. The \"Notifications & status bar\" option seems like a likely place where such a setting could be. I need to navigate there to explore further options.",
    "Action": "click text (Notifications & status bar)"
  },
  "4": {
    "Observation": "The current screenshot shows the \"Notifications & Status Bar\" settings page. There are several options, including \"Lock screen,\" \"Banner,\" \"Badge,\" \"Status bar,\" and \"More settings.\" There are also toggles for app notifications at the bottom. Previously, I clicked on the \"Notifications & status bar\" text to navigate to this page.",
    "Thought": "To proceed, I should look for an option related to the status bar, as this is typically where internet speed indicators would be displayed. The option \"Status bar\" seems like the most likely place to find such settings.",
    "Action": "click text (Status bar)"
  },
  "5": {
    "Observation": "The current screenshot shows the \"Status bar\" settings page. Options include \"Notification icons,\" \"Battery style,\" \"Battery percentage,\" and various \"Status bar icons.\" One of the options is \"Real-time network speed,\" which is currently turned off. Previous operations involved navigating the settings app to reach this page.",
    "Thought": "Since the task is to display the real-time internet speed at the battery level on the status bar, the next step would be to enable the \"Real-time network speed\" setting.",
    "Action": "click text (Real-time network speed)"
  },
  "6": {
    "Observation": "In the current screenshot, we can see that the 'Real-time network speed' toggle on the 'Status bar' settings page is now enabled. There is an indicator in the status bar at the top of this screen that shows current internet speed (0.00 KB/S) in real-time.",
    "Thought": "Since the real-time network speed indicator is now visible at the status bar, the task is effectively completed. Therefore, no further action within the settings is needed to comply with the given instruction.",
    "Action": "stop."
